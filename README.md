# FlappyBird AI
Implementation of an optimization algorithm (Genetic Algorithm + Neural Nets) to play the Flappy Bird game.

# Code execution
The code has two main execution scripts:
    * `execute_training.py`: execute training pipeline to play the game;
    * `main.py`: main script to play the game in three distinct modes:
        * `trained_bird`: watch the trained bird play the game (it is fun! :))
        * `manual`: manual input from the keyboard;
        * `compete`: compete against the trained bird (Human vs AI).
